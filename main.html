            <br>
            Generic materials for a 3000/3000 Synchro is pretty good. Typically for higher ATK on anything higher than a Level 8 Synchro has archetype-specific monsters needed or requires more than one-and-one. Minimal ATK/DEF gain for every <a href="https://img.yugioh-card.com/ygo_cms/ygo/all/uploads/New_Terminology_and_card_text_for_webpage.pdf">banished</a> card early, but can grow much bigger with Chengying using its other effects. The ATK/DEF loss for the opponent, even at its smallest can ensure Chengying is the strongest ATK monster on the field. </p>
            <p>
            Banish any card from your grave to prevent Chengying being destroyed by a card effect is far from a 1-for-1, and adds to the first effect of Chengying, and then can trigger the second effect. Banishing a card on the opponent’s field and grave in response to a card being banished each turn is broken. Your opponent can’t try to destroy Chengying with a card effect because you will banish to prevent that, then banish a card on their field and in their grave, all the while pumping up Chengying and dropping the opponent’s monsters ATK/DEF. Banishing avoids most protections monsters have and prevent advantage off destruction. Chengying is one of the cards to help trigger the banish effects the Spell/Trap cards in the archetype have, but while that is good you want other monsters or Tokens on the field to modulate their levels when you do that.</p>
            <p>
            Chengying something that can be used in a banish deck as well as Wyrm-based and Swordsoul. It is strong, easy to summon, and as long as you can supply it with cards in the grave to banish you will be banishing your opponent’s cards and preventing Chengying from being destroyed by a card effect. It is the boss of the Swordsoul archetype.
